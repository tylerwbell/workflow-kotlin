 * of the next-nearest [ViewTreeLifecycleOwner] above it (it mirrors its parent's lifecycle until
 * it's destroyed), and can be [asked to destroy][destroyOnDetach] itself early.
 *
 * This type is meant to help integrate with [ViewTreeLifecycleOwner] by allowing the creation of a
 * tree of [LifecycleOwner]s that mirrors the view tree.
 *
 * Custom container views that use [ViewRegistry.buildView] to create their children _must_ ensure
 * they call [destroyOnDetach] on the outgoing view before they replace children with new views.
 * If this is not done, then certain processes that are started by that view's subtree may continue
 * to run long after the view is been detached, and memory and other resources may be leaked.
 *
 * Set a [WorkflowLifecycleOwner] on a view by calling [installOn], and read it back using [get].
